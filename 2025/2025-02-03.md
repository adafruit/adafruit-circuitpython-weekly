### 3:11 CircuitPython 9.2.4 Released

CircuitPython 9.2.4 is the latest bugfix revision of CircuitPython and is a new stable release \- [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2025/01/28/circuitpython-9-2-4-released/) and release notes \- [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/9.2.4).  
Highlights of this release

* Update frozen modules, including a fix for `adafruit_requests`.  
* `audiofilters`: add `Distortion` and implement LFO ticking.  
* Add `canio` support for i.MX boards.  
* Fix RP2 `picodvi` crash.  
* Fix STM USB crashes.

### 4:11 ESP32-C5 Engineering Samples Are Out

The ESP32-C5 is the first 32-bit single-core RISC-V-based MCU from Espressif to support both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz WiFi 6, along with Bluetooth 5 (LE) and IEEE 802.15.4 standards. The dual-band support opens new possibilities for IoT applications, allowing devices to operate on the less crowded 5 GHz band for lower latency and more reliable connectivity. The inclusion of advanced WiFi 6 features such as Target Wake Time (TWT), MU-MIMO, and OFDMA ensures improved performance in dense network environments \- [Circuit Digest](https://circuitdigest.com/news/breaking-barriers-espressifs-esp32-c5-brings-5-ghz-wi-fi-to-iot-devices), [Espressif](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c5) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glEvHRHdboA).

## 16:29 Hug reports

17:05 @danh (hosting)

* @eightycc for systematically debugging slow network performance. This is work in progress.  
* @Timeline8 for a thorough report on an ESP32-S2 I2C problem.  
* @Hathach for getting TinyUSB ready to be used under zephyr.

17:42 @DJDevon3 (text only)

* @Timeline in discord for responding to a request for updating their playground note.    
* @AxelMagnus for taking an interest in a font I made and learning about font forge.  
* @Danh, @elpkenin, @Anecdata, @Neradoc, and many others for helping people in discord.   
* @BlitzCityDIY for the [turntable asyncio code](https://learn.adafruit.com/stepper-motor-turntable/code-the-turntable). Credit to the Ruiz brothers for the beautiful mechanics and aesthetics. Wonderful project.

18:18 @foamyguy

* @PaulCutler for interviewing me for an episode of the CircuitPython show podcast  
* @makermelissa for working on some fixes to the web editor  
* @Jepler for paving the way for RGB Matirx on RPi 5  
* Group hug

18:47 @tannewt (out)

* Group hug

19:03 @relic-se (text only)

* @gamblor21 & @jepler for the great reviews on audio effects related PRs.

## 19:20 Status Updates

19:33 @danh (hosting)

* I went through all the open CircuitPython issues. I closed about three dozen and commented on a bunch more, including linking some together.  
* Fixed a light sleep issue on RP2. There is a PR in progress by @bablokb to add sleep for RP2350.   
* Fixed some doc bugs and improved the circuitpython issue submission template to ask for board info.  
* Worked on NINA-FW more over the weekend, getting back to where I was before. I had a confusing problem until I realized I was missing a ground wire that was there previously. Things sort of worked but the ground was through two USB lines so SPI was not reliable.

22:12 @DJDevon3 (text only)

* Figured out how to automate font forge to create a font with a list of pixel sizes at the same time. This is something that I believe should be added to the Ruiz Brothers [font forge learn guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/custom-fonts-for-pyportal-circuitpython-display/conversion). This is the primary guide I’ve always used when occasionally making fonts. I never learned how to easily make multiple fonts of the same size because it’s not in the guide.   
* Worked on an [NTP RTC function example](https://github.com/DJDevon3/My_Circuit_Python_Projects/blob/main/Boards/espressif/Adafruit%20Feather%20ESP32-S3/Adafruit%20NTP%20Clock/code.py). The function supports a timezone offset and a secondary manual offset (specifically designed for helping to program an alarm clock).

23:04 @eightycc (text only)

* Working on an interesting RP2 network performance bug (\#9837). It’s given me a chance to exercise my ramlog logging facility. With a debug build and intensive logging I’m able to capture a large trace of network activity without impacting network performance.

23:34 @foamyguy

* RPi 5 \+ RGB Matrix examples  
  * Multiple panels  
  * Mp4 videos with VLC  
  * Scrolling text from web API  
  * Rainbowy and fun abstract art with PIL, rainbow snake and metaballs  
  * Attempted doom and pygame, unsuccessful so far  
* Library PR reviews & testing

  	

25:50 @tannewt (out)

* Ari is home with a low fever so I’m WFH when I can until he’s back at daycare.  
* Got WiFi scanning working on nrf7002dk. Intended on continuing that but got distracted polishing build stuff.  
* The build is in much better shape now. CI runs and zephyr jobs pass. Nordic job is broken due to nrfx version mismatch between new tinyusb and our ports implementation.  
* Will hack the nordic build so it passes and then PR it all.

## 26:43 In The Weeds

@DJDevon3 (text only)

* Currently there’s no way to leave feedback on a playground note like you can with a learn guide.  The playground system has now been around long enough to where some notes are becoming outdated and there’s no way to contact the author to update their note. \[I’ve queried the devs about this. –danh\]

30:17 @danh

* Stop updating 8.x bundle and otherwise deprecate 8.x? See [https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/9001](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/9001).   
  * Scott: Yup\! This would free us up to do 10.x prereleases. Maybe we want to branch for it? I suspect we’ll keep 9.x stable for a while though.

## 31:52 Wrap-Up

* Next week’s meeting is Monday, February 10, 2025, at 2pm US ET / 11am US PT as usual. The meeting *after* that will be delayed a day due to a US holiday: Tuesday, February 18, 2025\.
