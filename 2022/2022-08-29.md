### 03:10 Check Out the Simulator in the beta micro:bit Python Editor
A simulator is now available within the beta micro:bit Python Editor. This allows you to try your code before sending it to a micro:bit. The developers are fine tuning it over the next few weeks, so send them your feedback to help make it even better - [micro:bit newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/microbit.org/please-test-the-simulator-in-our-new-python-editor)


### 03:43 The MicroPython Forum Migration to GitHub Discussions
After close to 9 years, the MicroPython team has decided to close their forum in favor of moving to GitHub Discussions - MicroPython [Forum Post](https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=12971&sid=329429aeedb4a492901c29391b2c14e6) and [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/micropython/discussions).

Pybricks runs on LEGO® BOOST, City, Technic, MINDSTORMS®, and SPIKE®. You can code using Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebook, and Android. MIT License Open Source - [PyBricks](https://pybricks.com/).
### 04:45 VSCode Upload to via the New CircuitPython 8 Web Workflow
Luke Williams is working on a task definition and Python script to upload from VS Code to CircuitPython board via web workflow REST API. It's a work in progress at this time. It shows how leveraging new features in CircuitPython 8 can help development - [GitHub](https://github.com/ae5au/vscode-circuitpython-webupload).
### 05:30 Thonny Version 4.0.0
Thonny 4.0.0 has emerged from beta with many changes and fixes. A main change is they dropped support for Python 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7. There are about two dozen changes for MicroPython and CircuitPython - [GitHub](https://github.com/thonny/thonny/releases).

24:28 @2231puppy
* Last week
   * Finished up work on my digital fidget board, the E-Fidget
* This week
   * Assemble the E-Fidget and test it!


24:59 @danh
* About to release 7.3.3, which has several new and backported fixes.
* Continuing to fix bugs for 8.0.0.
* Implementing enabling/disabling the status bar on the console or the display.


26:17 @david.g (not speaking)
* Checking boards that pretend to have a display on circuitpython.org, trying to find a “definition” (see In The Weeds)
* New attempt at doing something useful with my temperature sensor (lywsd03mmc)
* Followed the guide on compiling CP and successfully rebuilded QT-Py UF2
* Lilygo T-Watch 2020 v3 (ESP32):
   * CP:
      * Installing Espressif SDK and compiling CP for other ESP32 board
      * Considering the possibility to port CP to the watch
      * Checking what component already have a CP library
      * Comparing v1, v2 and v3 watch for pin usage: https://gist.github.com/dglaude/f1d9f5a295bd53fb82fdf68129b51b3b
   * Non-CP:
      * Checking MP firmware availability and trying to compile
      * Checking how to add a board to WipperSnapper
      * Compiling and flashing HackWatch (BLE/WIFI/IR hacking) https://github.com/virtualabs/hackwatch


27:48 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Not CircuitPython, but the updated qmk came out and has lots of rp2040 goodness
   * Tried to figure out the mystery of the esp32-eye flakiness but didn’t. Setting aside for now, as the esp32-s3 is the focus of camera activity
   * Got the pi-cow blinking its LED, which means communication with the wifi part is working!
   * New guide pages for camera stuff finished but not published yet
* This week:
   * Picow all around
   * Out Tuesday


29:27 @kattni
* Belated hug report to Melissa for finding the ESP32 V2 on circuitpython.org when the rest of us couldn’t
* Belated hug report to DanH for giving me a build without the CircuitPython status bar enabled so I could continue working on my project, and for working on a way to disable it in code.
* Last week:
   * Published the ESP32-S3 TFT Feather guide
   * Picked up the ESP32 V2 Feather and began digging into the various WiFi workflow options, intended for a guide on building a WiFi mailbox notifier
   * Found a bug with CircuitPython and Thonny where Thonny locks up when an exception is thrown by the code - turned out to be related to the status bar. Dan provided a CP build with the status bar disabled, and Thonny works as intended again.
   * Spent more time in the WiFi workflow, trying to get into a habit with it because the native USB workflow is so ingrained into me at this point.
   * Spent time looking into WiFi data sending options, narrowed it down to mDNS, HTTP, or UDP.
   * Sorted out working on two WiFi microcontrollers at the same time, using Thonny, and sorted out a way to identify which Feather is which.
   * Turns out I was meant to use Adafruit IO and only one Feather, so the WiFi data discussions are info in my brain for future projects. 
   * Created working code that sends switch notifications and battery voltage to Adafruit IO.
   * Tested deep sleep, got excited because the PPK graph sure looked like I had deep sleep working until I zoomed in and found out it was still pulling light sleep numbers. Turns out it may be an issue with CircuitPython pulling all pins high (instead of the previous behavior which was to let them float) when going into deep sleep. Dan’s planning to take a look at it when he’s through with his current mission.
* This week:
   * Start on the Mailbox Notifier guide.
   * Assume the deep sleep issue will be resolved.
   * Will be including the LoRa version of the mailbox notifier project alongside the WiFi version. I’m going to redo the existing code to work on two Feathers, but will still include the Pi code (without explanation) for folks who have extra Pis sitting around already.
   * Probably misc.


32:39 @kmatch
* Bowling detector training aid
   * Last week: Proved that an ultrasonic sensor has the resolution and speed for capturing the distance to fast-moving spheres. Demonstrated the position indicator. 
   * This week: Design and test the initial mechanical design. Improve the accuracy by smoothing the data and weeding out noise. 


33:29 @makermelissa
* Last week:
   * Submitted a huge PR to add about 15 missing CircuitPython and Blinka boards on circuitpython.org as well as go through and update some feature names on Blinka boards
   * Worked on code.circuitpython.org mostly.
   * I ended up reworking the File Dialog a bit in order to add Uploading, Downloading, and File/Folder renaming
   * I also added Dialog Layering so now over 4000 could be stacked up if needed and increasing this number would be trivial, but it likely will never be more than a few deep in practice.
   * Replaced the hterm component with xterm so it’s now compatible with Firefox
   * Lots of small misc bug fixes.
   * Added a bug fix to the circuitpython core to add some missing Web Workflow acceptable CORS headers
   * Started working on adding Device Discovery
* This week:
   * Continue working on Device Discovery
   * Work on feature to allow transferring work when jumping between devices
   * Add more File Dialog Features
   * Update some of the components that are starting to age
   * Smooth out the overall flow
   * Lots of testing and more bug fixes probably

35:11 @tammymakesthings
* Last week:
   * Planning the first CircuitPython Office Hours
   * Respinning my CircuitPython build environment, which mysteriously seems to have broken on my MacBook
* This week:
   * Finishing getting my build environment working again
   * PR reviews!
   * Learning how to use the Discord mod functions
   * Doing some research into audio processing generally and also with CircuitPython, because I have a project idea (guitar effects pedal for my ukulele in CircuitPython) and I want to figure out if it’s feasible.
* Non-CircuitPython
   * Built a not-to-scale prototype of a [tensegrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity) table out of popsicle sticks. Refining my design and going to build another scale prototype (or maybe 2) and ultimately want to construct a full-sized tensegrity coffee table from wood and steel cables or ropes.


36:41 @tekktrik (text only)
* Last week
   * Fix multiple WiFi network connectivity issue with PortalBase library
   * Removed LSM303 library from the bundle

   * Fix up a few new libraries before adding them to the Adafruit bundle
   * Also starting grad school classes this week!
## 37:53 In The Weeds
38:26 @tammymakesthings - The first of the new CircuitPython Office Hours will be happening on 10 September! Possible hours are 8-10AM ET. Office Hours will be on Discord using Discord Video. The video may be uploaded later to adafruit youtube, rather than streamed live. If you can volunteer to be present and answer questions, please get in touch with tammy or @tekktrik, or join the planning thread in #circutpython-dev


40:48 @david.g (text only) - What is or is not a “Display” in CircuitPython.org?
(trying to resolve issue #1032 and PR #1030 #1029 and #1028 from https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-org )
        Brainstorming questions (maybe check the picture):
* Is PewPew 8x8 a display: https://circuitpython.org/board/pewpew10/
